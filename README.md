##**Overview**

This is a Python-based Coffee Machine simulation demonstrating my skills in object-oriented programming (OOP), functions, loops, and resource management.
The program allows users to order coffee, select size, pay with virtual coins, optionally add sugar or a sticker, and manages inventory for Milk, Water, Coffee, and Sugar Packets.

##**What I Implemented**
	•	Classes & OOP: CoffeeMachine class encapsulates all behaviors, resources, and drink recipes.
	•	Methods & Functions: Functions for menu display, order processing, payment handling, sugar addition, and resource refill.
	•	Loops: Used for user input validation, retrying invalid entries, and preparing drinks step by step.
	•	Conditionals: Resource availability checks, payment validation, and optional sticker/sugar handling.
	•	File & Resource Management: Tracks resources, prevents running out of supplies, and prompts for refills.
	•	Interactive CLI: Clean command-line interface with dynamic prompts and updates.

##**Features**
	•	Multiple coffee types (Cappuccino, Espresso, Macchiato, Black, Americano, Mocha)
	•	Three sizes: Small, Medium, Large
	•	Coin-based payment system with automatic change calculation
	•	Optional sticker personalization
	•	Sugar addition with inventory tracking
	•	Resource refill and maintenance checks

##**How to Use**
	1.	Run main.py to start the machine.
	2.	View menu, select drink and size.
	3.	Choose sticker (optional).
	4.	Insert virtual coins until total price is reached.
	5.	Add sugar packets if desired.
	6.	Refill resources when prompted to keep the machine running.
